/**
 * What a {@code @DataJpaTest} needs on top of {@code application.yaml} to run against the embedded H2 that
 * {@code @AutoConfigureTestDatabase} swaps in for the Oracle datasource.
 * <p>
 * That annotation replaces the {@code DataSource} only. The JPA settings of {@code application.yaml} still apply, and
 * they are written for the installed {@code CO} schema, so on H2 they mean an empty database with no {@code CO} schema
 * in it ({@code Schema "CO" not found}). This undoes exactly those, and turns off the {@code showSql} that
 * {@code @DataJpaTest} switches on by default.
 * <p>
 * {@link _Repository_DataJpaTest} imports it, so a test extending that class has it already. A slice test that does not
 * extend it pulls it in with {@code @Import(_Repository_DataJpaTest_Configuration.class)}. A slice test that wants the
 * installed schema instead leaves this out and adds {@code @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = Replace.NONE)}.
